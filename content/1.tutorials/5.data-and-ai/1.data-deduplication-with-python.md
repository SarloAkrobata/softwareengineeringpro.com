# Comprehensive Crash Course - Data Deduplication

## Module 1: Introduction to Data Deduplication
Many big data companies are struggling to address the record linkage challenge, which ranges from defining the appropriate logic to making the process scalable and cost-effective. Record linkage is a method in data management that identifies and links related records within or across datasets, thereby greatly improving data quality and consistency. This technology is essential in the era of big data, as it aids organizations in handling large volumes of data by ensuring data accuracy and integrity. Since its development, record linkage has evolved to incorporate more advanced algorithms and techniques, enhancing the efficiency and accuracy of data management. The real-world applications of this technology underscore its significance in enhancing data management across various industries.
